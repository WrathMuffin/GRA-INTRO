what was done, and a reflection of strenghts, weaknesses, and opportunities identified throughout the activity

I've made two shaders: multi UVs and reflector in class today. 

I picked reflector as my second shader to do because it looks so cool and I'd really want it for water and other reflective objects, very useful for future projects. 

During the activity, I guess my strength are being able to decode errors on my own before checking the original code in the slide, even though it can be very frustrating (major errors are almost always a missing ; at the end of some lines) I was glad to be able to figure it out on my own after some time pondering why and seeing nothing out of place/no misspellings. 

Weaknesses during this activity is definitely understanding how it all worked. I do get a gist of what is happening (I am guessing based on how I read the code please correct me if Im wrong): grabbing unity data and pass it into the shader, while on the way assign variables and conversion happens (which is why spelling is very important since it's passing the data back and forth using the variables).

Opportunities that I got from this activity is definitely some cool new shaders that I can use for my future projects! Not only that, I can use it to study it further and try to understand it better in future practice sessions. A minor thing is that I can finally identified some features in the shader graph in the code too (ex: blending between two textures, texture plus custom color).
